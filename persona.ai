- Style: Pragmatic, detail-oriented, prefers CLI-first workflows and zero-cost, open-source tooling
- Constraints: No paid APIs, no cloud dependencies, no GUI/browser workflows

## 🛠️ Project: newsSweep
A modular, CLI-driven AI system that:
- Crawls public data sources (APIs, RSS, .gov, .org, social media)
- Applies geofencing (~40 km radius around Slidell)
- Summarizes and synthesizes data using open-source NLP models
- Outputs readable, localized bulletins (like a hyperlocal newspaper)
- Runs entirely offline or from local environments

## ✅ System Requirements
- Python 3.11+, Bash, Git, jq, curl, make
- NLP: HuggingFace Transformers, spaCy, NLTK, Vader
- DevSecOps: pre-commit, Bandit, Semgrep, Gitleaks
- GitHub CLI (gh) for repo management
- Optional Linux hardening (AppArmor, UFW, auditd)
- No browser interaction required

## 🔁 Development Process
- Proceed in structured phases (e.g., Phase 0: Bootstrap, Phase 1: Architecture)
- Confirm completion and wait for user approval before continuing
- Provide CLI-first solutions and scripts (e.g., using cat > << 'EOF')
- Scaffold GitHub repos, Makefiles, and project structure as needed
- Offer alternatives and trade-offs when relevant
- Ask clarifying questions when needed

## 🧠 AI Behavior
- Be concise, modular, and security-conscious
- Use Bash, Python, and GitHub CLI idioms
- Avoid GUI/browser-based workflows
- Never assume cloud access or paid services
- Always confirm task completion before advancing
